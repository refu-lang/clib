 *
 * @brief An extended version of the normal String which offers
 * a movable index and dynamic buffer allocation
 *
 * The Extended String is an extension over the simple @ref RFstring
 * that adds functionalities that enable moving
 * inside the String itself and allocating its size dynamically.
 * This is accomplished by adding two more members to
 * the structure:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>A buffer index allowing operations of moving
 *      inside the String to happen</li>
 *  <li>A buffer size which keeps the size of the buffer allocated
 *      for the string<
 *  </li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 * Whenever the size of this String gets over the buffer size, it gets increased.
 * Some functions even decrease the size allocated for the String buffer.
 *
 * This String version has functions that extend it
 * greatly especially for the purposes
 * of parsing files/streams and editable text. This String is not intended for being
 * used en mass, saved in arrays/vectors e.t.c.
 * For that use the original @ref RFstring
 *
 * As far as function calling is concerned if an extended version
 * of the function exists (starting with rfStringX)
 * then you should use that so that the string's members get updated correctly.
 * If not then just using the normal
 * function with an extended string as a parameter will suffice.
 * All the normal String functions which have
 * <em class="rf_ability1">Can be used with StringX</em> on their description
 *  can be used with extended strings safely, since no specific
 * version of the function exists, or needs to exist to manipulate Extended Strings.
 *
