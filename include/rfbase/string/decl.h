 * @brief A unicode String with UTF-8 internal representation
 *
 * The Refu String is a Unicode String that has two versions. One is this and for
 * the other check @ref RFstringx to see what operations can be performed
 * on extended Strings.
 * Functions to convert to and from all UTF encoding exists but the internal
 * representation is always at UTF-8. Once a String has been created it is
 * always assumed that the stream of bytes inside it is valid UTF-8 since
 * every function performs a UTF-8 check unless otherwise specified.
 *
 * All the functions which have @isinherited{StringX} on their
 * description can be used with extended strings safely, since no specific
 * version of the function exists, or needs to exist to manipulate
 * Extended Strings. To make the documentation even clearer the
 * functions that should not
 * be used with the extended string are marked with @notinherited{StringX}
 *

 * String(){this->i_StringCHandle = rf_string_create("");}
