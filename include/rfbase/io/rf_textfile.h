/**
 * @brief Initializes a new text file
 *
 * This function initializes a new textfile object. You have the option to
 * either open an already existing TextFile by using
 * either @c RF_FILE_READ , @c RF_FILE_WRITE or @c RF_FILE_READWRITE for the
 * @c mode argument. In that case the file shall also
 * be tested for the existence of a Byte Order Mark.
 *
 * To create a new file use either @c RF_FILE_NEW or @c RF_FILE_READWRITE_NEW.
 * A Byte Order Mark will be appened to the file
 * depending on the given @c encoding argument unless the library has been
 * compiled with the @c RF_OPTION_TEXTFILE_ADDBOM off.
 * Note that if a specific endianess for UTF-16 or UTF-32 is not given then
 * the file will be created in the system's endianess.
 * @lmsFunction
 * @param t                      The textfile to initialize
 * @param name                   The name of the file.
 *                               @inhtype{String,StringX} @tmpSTR
 * @param mode                   The mode with which to access the file.
 *                               For legal values take a look
 *                               at @ref RFtextfile_mode
 *
 *                               This parameter serves as but a hint of what
 *                               operation should follow the initialization.
 *                               The reason is that each of the functions that
 *                               operate on an @ref RFtextfile check the
 *                               current mode and if it is not the legal mode
 *                               for that operation the file is reopened with
 *                               the proper mode, or has its file pointer
 *                               rewinded and then put back if it is in
 *                               read/write mode.
 * @param endianess              The endianess of the file. Is useful only if
 *                               the encoding of the file is in UTF-32 or UTF-16.
 *                               Look at @ref RFendianess for possible values.
 *                               In the case or @ref RF_ENDIANESS_UNKNOWN
 *                               the file is scanned in an attempt to determine
 *                               its endianess
 * @param encoding               The encoding of the file. For legal values
 *                               take a look at @ref RFtext_encoding
 *
 * @param eol                    The End Of Line type that this textfile uses.
 *                               The value of @c RF_EOL_AUTO should not be given
 *                               if this is a newly created file. If that is done
 *                               an invalid argument error is logged and the file
 *                               is initialized with @c RF_EOL_LF. In addition
 *                               if the auto-detection fails for some reason
 *                               the default @c RF_EOL_DEFAULT will be used and
 *                               appropriate error logging will be performed.
 *                               For possible value look at @ref RFeol_mark
 *
 * @return                       Returns @c true in success
