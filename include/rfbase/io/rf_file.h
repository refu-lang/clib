 *
 * The character pattern that shall be considered as newline signal depends
 *  on the value the user passes to the @c eol argument.
 *
 * The function will read until @c num characters are read and if @c num
 * would take us to the middle of a UTF16 character then the next character
 *  shall also be read
 * and the function will return the number of bytes read.
 * Since the function null terminates the buffer the given @c buff needs to be
 * of at least @c num+5 size to cater for the worst case.
 *
 * The final bytestream stored inside @c buff is in the endianess of the system.
 *
 * If right after the last character read comes the EOF, the function
 * shall detect so and assign @c true to @c eof.
