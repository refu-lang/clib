/**
 * @brief TextFile handler
 *
 * This is a TextFile handler that allows for the manipulation of files that contain
 * text in any of the UTF encodings.
 *
 * It is made to work with files and not generic streams like pipes. It can also
 * work with stdin but it admittedly feels like a hack, added over old code.
 *
 * It allows for manipulation of a text file without placing the whole file in memory
 * and contains many different functions for moving inside the file in regards to specific line positions
 * or even retrieving said lines themselves inside an @ref RF_String.
 * For individual line parsing it is recommended to use the @ref RFstring and @ref RFstringx functions.
